## 👋 Hi, I’m Debanjan Mondal  

I’m an AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that combine  
**Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**,  
and modern **Generative AI** technologies.

- 👀 I’m interested in: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, LLMs, Agentic Systems  
- 🌱 Currently learning: Generative AI • Model Architectures • AgentOps • RAG Systems  
- 📫 Reach me at: **dmondal896@gmail.com**

## 🚀 My AI Ecosystem  
I maintain a structured ecosystem of AI-driven project series — each designed with a clear purpose, learning approach, and long-term vision.

### 🎭 **AIF — AI For Fun**  
Creative, experimental, and entertainment-driven AI projects.  
This series explores playful generative applications like:
- Audio-drama generators  
- Storytelling agents  
- Meme engines  
- Fun LLM experiments  
AIF is where imagination meets AI engineering.

### 🌱 **AIG — AI For Good**  
Impact-oriented projects designed to help people, improve access, and solve real-world problems.  
Focus areas include:  
- Education & learning assistance  
- Healthcare triage helpers  
- Agriculture support agents  
- Civic-information tools  
AIG reflects the belief that AI should meaningfully serve society.

## 🔬 **RAI — Raysearcher AI**  
**Raysearcher AI** is my tribute-driven initiative inspired by **Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray**,  
the father of modern Indian chemistry, who said:  
> *“The highest function of science is to serve humanity.”*

Raysearcher-AI represents the research backbone of my ecosystem.

## 📚 Learning Series  

### 🧪 **HandsOn Series**  
Practical, implementation-first notebooks & mini-projects.  
Focused on real code, real datasets, and real deployments.

### ⚙️ **From Scratch Series**  
Rebuilding ML and AI concepts from the ground up:  
optimizers, networks, transformers, tokenizers — step by step.

### 🧩 **Grokking Series**  
Deep-dive case studies, system design approaches, architecture breakdowns,  
and end-to-end explanations of complex AI systems.

## ✨ My Motivation  
I aim to build AI systems that are:
- **Understandable**, not magical  
- **Purposeful**, not gimmicky  
- **Helpful**, not harmful  

Always guided by the belief:  
**“Technology is meaningful only when it serves people.”**
